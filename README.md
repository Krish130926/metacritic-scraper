Metacritic New Album Releases Scraper

## Description
This Python project scrapes the latest album releases from [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/albums/release-date/available/metascore) and extracts valuable data such as album titles, artists, release dates, metascores, and user scores. The goal is to provide an overview of the top 10 recently released albums along with their user and critic ratings. 

The project also visualizes user scores using a bar chart and computes basic analytics, such as average metascores and user scores, to help users quickly assess the popularity of recent music albums.

## Website Chosen
The project uses **Metacritic** as its source for album data because it aggregates scores from both critics and users, making it a trusted and popular platform for music reviews. The data is highly relevant for users looking to discover the latest music releases with detailed feedback from a broad audience.

## Features
- Scrape the latest 10 albums with details including title, artist, release date, metascore, user score, and summary.
- Visualize user scores of the top albums using a bar chart.
- Analyze the average metascore and user score of the top albums.
- Rate-limiting implemented to prevent overwhelming the server.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metacritic-scraper.git
cd metacritic-scraper



Install Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python libraries.
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Scraper
Execute the scraper by running the Python script:
python scraper.py

The program will scrape the latest 10 album releases from Metacritic, display the data in the terminal, generate a bar plot for user scores, and perform basic data analysis.


Visualization Example
Future Improvements
•	Implementing additional filtering options for scraping (e.g., by genre or release year).
•	Enhancing data visualization by plotting both metascores and user scores.
•	Introducing functionality to scrape more than 10 albums.

# Ethical Considerations of Web Scraping

## Introduction
Web scraping is a powerful tool for gathering large amounts of data from publicly accessible websites. However, it comes with ethical considerations, especially regarding the legality, website owner policies, and the potential impact on servers.

This project scrapes album data from Metacritic, a publicly accessible website, while adhering to ethical standards of scraping, including respecting the site's terms of service and implementing rate limiting.

## Ethical Considerations

### 1. **Respect for Website's Terms of Service**
It is important to always review and follow a website's terms of service (ToS) before scraping. In this project, we ensure that Metacritic's ToS is respected by:
- Scraping only publicly available information.
- Using a valid `User-Agent` header to identify the request origin.
- Limiting the amount of data extracted to a small subset (10 albums) to avoid overloading the site.

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
Excessive requests to a server in a short period can overwhelm the site’s infrastructure, affecting the service for other users. To address this, we have implemented a **rate-limiting mechanism** by introducing a delay of 5 seconds between requests. This prevents unnecessary strain on Metacritic's servers.

### 3. **No Harmful Actions**
Our scraper does not attempt to bypass any security mechanisms, nor does it access restricted content. It avoids activities like:
- Ignoring robots.txt files (if they exist).
- Circumventing CAPTCHAs or other barriers intended to restrict scraping.

### 4. **Transparency and User Privacy**
We only scrape data that is publicly available, and we do not collect any personal user data from Metacritic. The scraper’s purpose is purely informational, intended to help music fans stay updated with new album releases.

## Legal Considerations
Web scraping operates in a grey area when it comes to legality, depending on the country and the website's specific terms. While the data collected in this project is publicly available, users of this script should still review Metacritic’s terms of service and any applicable laws to ensure compliance.

## Conclusion
By carefully considering and addressing these ethical issues, this project seeks to strike a balance between data accessibility and respect for the rights of website owners and users. It is essential that we use scraping responsibly and ethically to ensure the sustainability of open data access.
